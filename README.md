# Provisioning
The idea of creating this repository arises from the desire to share my small knowledge of tools and methodologies that have attract my interest and curiosity.

At the begining I prepared the environments in order to skip those tedious tasks of building a server from scratch, when I try any tool that I have been reading about, but I also use them learn some methodologies that I would like to apply on my daily work. I even use the environments to test my code out when I develope any project for my own.

## Environments
- [Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery](continuous_delivery/README.md)
- [Mesos-marathon](mesos-marathon/README.md)

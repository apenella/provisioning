# Provisioning
The idea of creating this repository arises from the desire to share my small knowledge of tools and methodologies that attract my interest and curiosity.

At the begining I prepared the environments in order to skip the tedious tasks of building a server from scratch, when I try any tool that I have been reading about, but I also use them to learn some methodologies that I would like to apply on my daily work. I even use the environments to test my code out when I develope any project for my own.

## Environments
